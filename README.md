# My Portfolio Website
**Reverse Engineered** a react portfolio website found online, but in a nextJS envinronment.
Style changes and improvements t.b.d.

## Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
### I'm having issues deploying the website.. apparently css code is not being sent from the server correctly.
